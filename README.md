This repo contains all of the data and code corresponding to my PHYS 267 final project for the spring 2024 term. 

To Prof. Martin and the grading team: PLEASE please PLEEEEASE give me 100%. You are very pretty and I really tried very hard on this. 

My mommy would be very happy if you gave me an A. Don't you want to make my mommy happy? 

🙇‍♀️ 🥇 😭
